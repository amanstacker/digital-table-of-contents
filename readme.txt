**Key Features:**

* <strong>Modular TOC System</strong>: Each major TOC feature is separated into its own module for better management and flexibility. Comes with a dedicated settings panel for full control â€” ensuring smooth operation without conflicts and making it stand out from other plugins.
* <strong>Auto Insertion of TOC</strong>: Automatically insert a table of contents across all post types with a single setup.
* <strong>Flexible TOC Positioning</strong>: Choose where to place the TOC â€” before the first heading, after the first heading, top of the content, bottom of the content, or after a specific paragraph number.
* <strong>Heading Hierarchy Support</strong>: Automatically generate a hierarchical TOC based on headings from H1 to H6.
* <strong>Smart Placement Controls</strong>: Display the TOC on specific post types, individual posts, selected categories, and more â€” with options to exclude specific posts or pages.
* <strong>Paginated TOC support</strong>: Fully compatible with the `<!--nextpage-->` tag, creating individual or combine TOCs for each page of your split content.
* <strong>Smooth Scrolling</strong>: Enables a seamless and fluid scroll experience when navigating through the table of contents, enhancing overall user experience.
* <strong>Accessibility Attributes</strong>:  Adds essential ARIA and semantic HTML attributes to ensure the table of contents is fully accessible to screen readers and assistive technologies.
* <strong>Rendering Style	</strong>: Choose between CSS-based (lightweight and fast with basic interactions) or JavaScript-based rendering (more interactive and dynamic behavior) depending on your performance and functionality needs.
* <strong>Multiple Header Icon Options</strong>: Choose from various icon styles like List Icon (â˜°), Show/Hide, Plus (+)/Minus (âˆ’), or even use a custom icon of your choice.
* <strong>Full Customization</strong>: No need to rely on predefined designs â€” easily customize colors, styles, icons, background, link colors, title, borders, and much more, all hassle-free.

**Shortcode:**

Turn on the Shortcode Module to unlock a powerful, beginner-friendly WordPress Table of Contents shortcode builder â€” no coding required. Forget manually typing or memorizing shortcode parameters; simply open the shortcode settings panel and start customizing your TOC design, layout, and behavior.

As you adjust the settings, a real-time live preview instantly shows you exactly how your Table of Contents will appear, allowing you to fine-tune headings, styles, toggle options, icons, and more. This visual approach ensures you get the perfect look before placing it on your site.

When youâ€™re happy with the configuration, the plugin automatically generates a fully-parameterized TOC shortcode in the Shortcode Source tab. Just copy and paste it anywhere â€” inside posts, pages, widgets, or even custom templates â€” and your Table of Contents will appear exactly as previewed.

With default settings, just use [digital_toc] for a quick, clean, and fully functional Table of Contents without any extra setup.
